# Fake News Prediction Web Application

As part of our Machine Learning course,
my team and I collaborated on developing a web application using machine learning and Flask to accurately
classify news articles as fake or not fake. Following the successful completion of the course, we were motivated to
further enhance our project. Leveraging the knowledge acquired during the AWS Solutions Architect (Associate) bootcamp at Tuwaiq Academy,
we expanded our project to AWS. To ensure optimal performance, high availability, and robust security, we deployed the application on servers 
across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). This strategic decision allowed our application to leverage the advanced capabilities of AWS and 
enhance its overall functionality.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate web application.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Upload an article or paste text to get real-time predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Powered by a trained classification model for detecting fake news.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- pip (Python package manager)

## Usage

1. Enter or upload the article you'd like to analyze.
2. Click on the "Analyze" button.
3. View the prediction results: **Fake** or **Not Fake**.

## Dataset

The machine learning model is trained on publicly available datasets such as:
- [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news)
